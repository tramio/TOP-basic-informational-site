# Basic Informational Site !

**What?** a basic website to practice Node.js basics (create a server that listens to a port, use the http, url and fs modules) following introductions from **[The Odin Project's website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site)**. It was subsequently refactored into an Express app.

**When?** June 2022.

**Where?** Discover it live on Replit: **[Node-only](https://top-basic-informational-site.tramio.repl.co/)** or **[with Express](https://TOP-basic-informational-site-1.tramio.repl.co)**.
